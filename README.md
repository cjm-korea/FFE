## Hard Work
**Button in Adapter**
Button in equipment_item.xml is dynamic created thing. And it's not have Activity & Java class.  
so Create new Context and allocate view.getContext() for using Activity function.  
Button setOnClickListener is created since ViewHolder is created.  

**Spinner and Custom Actionbar**
Spinner and Custom Actionbar are need seperated xml.  
so make it and attach to Activity use Java is difficult things.  

# To do
improve ui and make icon_launcher
